Suppose we record the temperature three times during a day in October day and find
\[
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
\text{t} & 0 & 1 & 3\\
\text{Temp.} & 68 & 70 & 50
\end{array}
\]
where $t$ represents the number of hours after $8:00$a.m. Find the polynomial that best relates the time to the temperature on that day. 

\begin{prompt}
\[
p(x) = \answer{68} + \answer{6}x + \answer{-4}x^{2} + \answer{0}x^{3}
\]
\end{prompt}
