\begin{exercise}  For what value of $a$ does the following system of equations have no solutions, infinitely many solutions or solution: $x=y=2$. For any of the cases, write N/A if there is no such real number $a$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
5x+15y &=& 40\\
ax +3y &=& \frac{3}{8}
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{prompt}
a. The system of equations has no real solutions: $a= \answer{1}$\\
b. The system of equations has infinitely many solutions: $a= \answer{N/A}$\\
c. The system of equations has solution: $x=y=2$: $a=\answer{-45/16}$.
\end{prompt}
