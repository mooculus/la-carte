\begin{exercise}
For the following systems of equations,
\begin{align*}
\frac{6}{7} x + \frac{2}{11}y &= 30\\
(2a) x + \left(\frac{3}{8} b\right) y &= c,
\end{align*}
\begin{enumerate}
  %% TK: This problem is ill-posed. There are infinitely many possible
  %% answers, even if we set c = 1. In fact, any a = 3/7*k and b =
  %% 16/33*k, with k \neq 1/30, will do. Please review this.
\item Find the smallest positive numbers $a,b$, and the smallest positive
  whole number $c$ such that the system of equations has no solutions.
\begin{prompt}
  \[
  a= \answer{3/7}, \quad b= \answer{16/33}, \quad c=\answer{1}
  \]
 \end{prompt}

 %% TK: The following problem does have a unique answer, but not the
 %% one listed below: a = 1/70, b = 8/495, c = 1. Please review this.
\item Find the smallest positive numbers $a,b$, and the smallest positive
  whole number $c$ such that the system of equations has infinitely
  many solutions.
\begin{prompt}
  \[
  a= \answer{3/7}, \quad b= \answer{16/33}, \quad c = \answer{30}
  \]
\end{prompt}
\begin{hint}
 Note that for this problem, there is no need to first convert the matrix to row echelon form.
