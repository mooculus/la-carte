Suppose an airplane is scheduled to fly from Columbus to Cincinnati, a flight that takes 20min. \\
a. If its bearing is $240^{\circ}$ at $30$ knots, what are its coordinates when it reaches Cincinnati?\\
b. What are its coordinates at the end on a rainy day in which the airplane's bearing changes to $300^{\circ}$ at $15$ knots.
