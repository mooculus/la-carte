Suppose for a matrix $A: 5\times 5$, $det(A)=10$. Find the following. \\

a. $det(4A)$\\

b. $det(B)$ where $B$ is obtained by \\
-interchanging the second and fourth rows of matrix $A$\\
- multiplying the second row of $A$ by $8$\\
- dividing the third row of $A$ by $7$\\

c. $det(C)$ where $C$ is obtained by\\
- interchanging the first and third column of matrix $A$\\
- interchanging the second and fourth rows of $A$\\
- multiplying the fifth row of $A$ by $2$\\

d. $\frac{det(3A) + det (A^T)}{det(5C)} + det(2B)$
